				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>This is my third class at the Extension School; the others were Fundamentals of Website Development (Summer 2010), and Video Editing and Digital Design (Spring 2011).</p>
				
				<p>I am excited to learn PHP and to start creating dynamic web content. I do not like working in the command line (so far, anyway).</p>
			
				<p>I like documentary and experimental films. By day, I work as Director of Design & Media at <a href="http://www.der.org">Documentary Educational Resources</a>.</p>
			
				<p>I play drums in <a href="http://animalhospitalmusic.com/animal-hospital-ensemble">Animal Hospital Ensemble</a> and in <a href="http://www.geoglyphsounds.com/index.shtml">Geoglyphs</a>.</p>
